**Topic:** Handoff v2.3.0 Consistency Fixes (Synod Review + Team Execution)
**Working Directory:** /Users/ahnjundaram_g/dev/tools/claude-handoff-baton

## User Requests
- "지금 handoff의 길이가 꽤 긴 것 같은데 어떻게 생각해?"
- "recommendations를 검토해줘" (Synod 실행)
- "전부 진행해줘" (Team 실행)

## Summary
Analyzed handoff document length, proposed 4 recommendations, then ran Synod deliberation (3 agents: Architect/Explorer/Validator) which revealed all 4 were already solved in v2.3.0. Synod identified 3 real problems instead: validate.sh Check 5 bug, example-handoff.md regression risk, and dual scaling systems. Executed all 3 fixes via Team mode with 3 parallel executor agents.

## Completed
- [x] Analyzed 9 handoff files (65-159 lines) and identified length patterns across versions
- [x] Ran Synod review (synod-20260212-234004-a4e311) with Architect, Explorer, Validator -- reached early consensus at 85% confidence
- [x] Fixed validate.sh Check 5: changed from "2+ list items" to "non-empty content" for v2.3.0 compatibility
- [x] Rewrote examples/example-handoff.md from 465 lines to 49 lines in v2.3.0 format
- [x] Unified SKILL.md scaling from message-based to L1/L2/L3 token-based system with explicit budgets
- [x] Strengthened empty section rule: "MUST be omitted entirely. Do not output 'None' or 'N/A'."

## Pending
- [ ] Commit all changes to git
- [ ] Push to remote repository
- [ ] Update README.md and README-ko.md if needed to reference L1/L2/L3 system

## Key Decisions
- **Synod early exit at Phase 2**: All 3 agents converged on "recommendations already implemented in v2.3.0" -- skipped Defense round
- **L1/L2/L3 as canonical scaling**: Chose token-based over message-based because explicit budgets are more enforceable by LLMs
- **Level-prefixed file naming**: Added l1-/l2-/l3- prefix convention to handoff filenames for quick identification

## Failed Approaches
- **Original 4 recommendations (flatten Key Decisions, remove boilerplate, single Next Step, merge Known Issues)**: All already implemented in v2.3.0 -- analysis mixed old and new format files

## Files Modified
- `scripts/validate.sh` - Check 5 logic: list item count replaced with non-empty content check
- `examples/example-handoff.md` - Full rewrite from 465-line old format to 49-line v2.3.0 format (JWT auth example)
- `SKILL.md` - Lines 31-42: message-based scaling replaced with L1/L2/L3 table; Lines 107-110: empty section rule strengthened

## Constraints
- "한국어로 소통합니다" (from CLAUDE.md)

## Next Step
Commit the 3 modified files (validate.sh, example-handoff.md, SKILL.md) and push to remote. Consider tagging as v2.3.1 for the consistency fixes.
