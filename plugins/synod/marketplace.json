  "description": "Research-backed multi-agent deliberation with Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI - structured 3-round debates for superior decision-making",
  "longDescription": "Synod brings peer-reviewed multi-agent debate methodologies to Claude Code. Instead of relying on a single LLM prone to confirmation bias and hallucination, Synod orchestrates structured debates between Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI across three rounds: Solver, Critic, and Defense/Prosecution. Built on ReConcile (ACL 2024), AgentsCourt, ConfMAD, and A-HMAD research, it features confidence scoring (0-100), trust calculation using the CortexDebate formula, and anti-conformity mechanisms. Perfect for code review, architecture design, debugging, and brainstorming. Research shows 3-round debates capture >95% of quality improvements with token-efficient parallel execution.",
