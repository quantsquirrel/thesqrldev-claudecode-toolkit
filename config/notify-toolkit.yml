# Template workflow for upstream plugin repos.
# Copy this file to .github/workflows/notify-toolkit.yml in each plugin repo.
#
# Required setup:
#   1. Create a GitHub PAT with 'repo' scope (or fine-grained with 'contents: write')
#   2. Add it as a repository secret named TOOLKIT_DISPATCH_TOKEN
#      in the upstream plugin repo
#   3. Set PLUGIN_NAME to the plugin's name as registered in the toolkit
#      (must match the "name" field in config/registry.json)
